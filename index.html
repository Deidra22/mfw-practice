        <h3>I got married one    month   after turning 18. This was because my boyfriend (now husband) was joining the army. We have been married for 7 years. We have a 3 year old son named Abel. Joining Geekwise so far has been an amazing experience that I am hoping will lead into a fulfilling career.</h3>
